<p>I could never figure out why so many people wanted to come over until they confessed it was my recipe for glazed turkey. I do not stuff the turkey. Instead, I make my own stuffing on the side and serve it in a festive dish. The holiday season means it's turkey time. Gobble, gobble! </p>

        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>½ cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley</li>

    <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Rinse turkey, then pat thoroughly dry with paper towels. Brush turkey with extra-virgin olive oil, inside and out. </li>
        <li>Mix together 1 teaspoon salt, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; sprinkle all over turkey. Place turkey on a rack set in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast turkey in the preheated oven for 2 hours. </li>
        <li>While turkey is roasting, stir together honey, melted butter, parsley, sage, basil, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl until glaze is smooth and well blended. </li>
        <li>Brush some of the glaze over turkey. Continue roasting turkey, basting frequently with remaining glaze, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 2 more hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Remove turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area before slicing, 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
    </ul>
